### Rules
Timing starts upon clicking "Accept" on the character creation screen on Tutorial Island. 
Timing ends upon entering the Champions guild, which requires 32 quest points. 
- Must be an Ironman account.
- The account must not login to a Members' only world during the run. 
- Skippy is not allowed. 
- Timing must be RTA. 
- Mouse cursor must be visible.
- Must use the official game client.
- Multilogging is allowed at the moment, but must be noted with submission of the run.

(Multilogging is any other account having a direct effect on the run that the runner could control, I.E. Manipulating NPCs on an alt account, or picking up the ashes from another player's fire.)

### Terms
**[BANK]**: Deposit all inventory and worn items, withdraw the listed items.

**[Split]**: Commonly used split locations.

**[Deathwarp]**: Take an intentional death via the mentioned enemy.

**[Numbers in brackets]** i.e. **[1,2,1,4]**: Dialogue options you'll want to select when speaking to an NPC.

### Setup
Each run is started with a new account, with the email address authenticated, and the authenticator set up.

However, only one email address is needed to make any number of RuneScape accounts.

Create the email address you want to use for this.

It is recommended that you setup a short and memorable gmail account "usernamerun@gmail.com".

When setting up the runescape account, you can use the email "usernamerun+1@gmail.com", and increment it by one each run.

Your runescape login will be "usernamerun+1@gmail.com" and the authentication email will go to "usernamerun@gmail.com".

- Make a new oldschool runescape account, and complete email verification.
- Go to the main oldschool page and click enable authenticator.
- Open google authenticator on your phone and scan the code.
- Enter the code on the web page to enable authenticator.
- Log in on the client and enter the authenticator code.

### General Running Knowledge
If you log in to a new account, log out without finishing character creation, then log back in - You will no longer have the character creation screen, and the run is considered started here.
    
The first time you change world with an authenticator account you will be brought back to the authenticator verification. Hit cancel, and then enter your username and password again.

Hold spacebar through all dialogue.

Use number keys for all dialogue.
    
Run depletes faster the more weight you are carrying.  Stockpile run energy while carrying a heavy load, and run when you have a light load.
    
Always be in motion. Click doors and be walking on the next game tick. Stay prepared for your next action.
    
The openness of the game means there are a huge number of backup strats available to a runner. Much of this run was built from strats discovered on the fly after something went wrong. As it is in life, there are no mistakes. Only "happy little accidents".
